# The Battle of the Neighborhoods - Week 1

## Introduction & Business Problem :

### Problem Background:

Singapore is a multi racial society and as of mid-2018, the estimated population of Singapore was 5,638,700 people. 
The Singaporean economy is known as one of the most innovative, most competitive, most dynamic and most business-friendly.The 2015 Index of Economic Freedom ranks Singapore as the second freest economy in the world and the Ease of doing business index has also ranked Singapore as the easiest place to do business for the past decade. Singapore attracts a large amount of foreign investment as a result of its location, skilled workforce, low tax rates, advanced infrastructure and zero-tolerance against corruption.

However, Singapore was among the bottom 10 for work-life balance and ranked the second most overworked city in a study of 40 cities. (Source: channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-bottom-ranks-work-life-balance-second-most-overworked-11789264). 

This has lead to recommendations by the ministry to increase flexibility at work such that employees will better manage their time. Many employees find it hard to work from home due to the lack of discipline and for working parents, the lack of personal space and time. For many employers, they find it difficult to trust that their employees when they are not physically in the office.

### Problem Description:
An group of overseas investors wishes to set up a inclusive,integrated 24-hours working hub for professionals whereby there are facilities to help employees who find it difficult to work from home and to tackle problems such as childcare. The hub also has a time log system which employers can digitally track their employees' working hours. This is the first of its kind and if it is successful, many similar hubs will be set up in the residential areas such that employees are able to work within their neighborhood. The first hub will be located in an area where amenities are not readily available. 

Factors to be considered are: 

Residential land price 
Categories of shops located in that area (so as to determine what type of shops are to be included within the hub) 
Overview of the number of professionals residing in that area


### Target Audience:
The main target will be working professionals as well as companies who do not have physical workspaces and/or whose employees require work flexibility.
