However, there is a lack of job market for the people with wheelchair disabilities (PWD) and two-thirds of them are unable to work due reasons such as 
poor health or disability. (Source: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/disability-pwds-in-employment-mom-survey-parliament-zaqy-11863568)
In addition, despite the country's effort to improve the public environment such as using Universal Designs when constructing buildings 
(Source: https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/14/what-disability-accessible-city-look-like), there is still a lack of facilities
for the PWDs. 

**Problem Description**:
An investor wishes to set up a community centre for PWD. It is important to strategically locate this centre and the most important 
factors to be considered are: 

Wheelchair accessible shops/restuarants/supermarkets in the vicinity 
Does the surrounding has user-friendly built in environment such as ramps and wider doors? 
Are the pavements wide enough for the PWDs to move around? 
Are there too much traffic in the area especially during peak period?
